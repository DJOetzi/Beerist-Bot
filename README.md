# Beerist-Bot
Entertainment bot for Discord made with [D++ - the C++ Discord library](https://dpp.dev)

Invite Beerist to your Server [here](https://top.gg/bot/846722660523180042)!

## GUIDE FOR BUILDING AND SELFHOSTING

1. clone source using `git clone https://github.com/Progame03/Beerist-Bot.git`
2. open the project file (.sln) in visual studio
3. make sure to link the latest Version of D++ correctly (guide for it is [here](https://dpp.dev/build-a-discord-bot-windows-visual-studio.html))
4. hit F5 or ctr+shift+B (depends on localization)
5. add all required parameters to baseconfig.json
6. start up the bot using the local windows debugger or fire up the executable directly
7. congrats, you've now compiled your very own build of the Beerist which can be transferred to other machines
8. profit

## WARNING
As of now, the current codebase was built pretty badly in a rather short amount of time. Once I'm able to work more on the bot, expect big changes to happen in short periods of time.
